**Overview**

This repository contains scripts and queries for analyzing COVID-19 data, focusing on various metrics such as total cases, deaths, vaccinations, and their impact on different regions and populations. The analysis is conducted using SQL queries on datasets of COVID-19 cases and vaccinations.

**Data Sources**

1) CovidDeaths: Dataset containing information about COVID-19 cases and deaths, including location, date, total cases, total deaths, and population.
2) CovidVaccinations: Dataset providing details about COVID-19 vaccinations, including location, date, and the number of new vaccinations.

**Queries**

1) Select Data: Retrieves relevant data from the CovidDeaths table for analysis.
2) Total Cases vs Total Deaths: Calculates the death percentage in a specific location based on total cases and total deaths.
3) Total Cases vs Population: Calculates the percentage of population infected with COVID-19 in a specific location.
4) Highest Infection Rates: Identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.
5) Highest Death Count per Population: Lists countries with the highest death count per population.
6) Continent Analysis: Breaks down data by continent, showing the continent with the highest death count per population.
7) Global Numbers: Provides global statistics on total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.
8) Population vs Vaccinations: Analyzes the relationship between population and COVID-19 vaccinations.
9) Using CTE: Demonstrates the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for analyzing population vs vaccinations.
10) Temporary Table Approach: Shows an alternative approach using temporary tables for data analysis.
11) Creating View: Defines a view for storing data to facilitate later visualization.
